    "To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **train.csv**  - Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\n",
    "\n",
    "HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n",
    "\n",
    "CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age - The age of the passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\n",
    "\n",
    "RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name - The first and last names of the passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **test.csv** - Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **sample_submission.csv** - A submission file in the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "PassengerId - Id for each passenger in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transported - The target. For each passenger, predict either True or False.\n",
